    "1. Conciseness - Lambda function allow yoy to write short,one line function and this can make code more concise and easier to read.\n",

    "2. Readability - while lambda funciton can sometimes make code harder to read if overused or misused,they can improve readability when used appropriately.\n",

    "3. Functionaal programming - Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms where functionas are treated as mathematical constructs and perform complex operations.Lambda functions creation of higher-order function i.e.map,fitter,reduce which operate on collections of data.\n",
    "\n",
